# SQL Check Frontend

This repo is a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server from the sqlchk folder (not frontend):

```bash
make dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
